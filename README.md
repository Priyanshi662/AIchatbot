# Imagify

## Description
Imagify is a practice project developed using Node.js, the OpenAI API, MongoDB, and Mongoose. The purpose of this project is to take input prompts from the user and generate an image based on the provided description. Initially created as a personal project, it serves as a learning tool for backend development, database integration, and making API calls. Imagify provides a basic understanding of how the backend works.

## Tech Stack
The following technologies have been utilized in this project:

- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime that allows server-side execution of JavaScript code.
- OpenAI API: An interface provided by OpenAI that enables the generation of images based on user prompts.
- MongoDB: A NoSQL database used for storing and managing data.
- Mongoose: A MongoDB object modeling library for Node.js that provides a straightforward way to interact with the database.

## Usage
To use Imagify, you need to have Node.js and MongoDB installed on your machine. Follow the steps below:
